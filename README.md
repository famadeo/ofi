## Introduction
Order flow imbalance refers to the difference between buy and sell orders in the market. Understanding its impact on price movements can help traders and analysts make informed decisions.

## Background
Previous studies have shown that order flow imbalance can influence short-term price changes. This project builds on existing research to further investigate this relationship in equity markets.

## Methodology
We use statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze order flow data. The methodology includes:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation

## How to Run an Experiment
To run an experiment, follow these steps:

1. **Download Data Files**:
    - Manually download the required data files from `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yaZZ-kkn1l64CYVWY2qCMFNdAkA7MFkp?usp=drive_link`.
    - Save the downloaded files to the `/data` folder in your project directory.
    - Or alternatively run the script at the beginning of the Pipeline notebook

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    - Open the `pipeline` Jupyter notebook located in the project directory.
    - Execute all cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and generate results.

By following these steps, you will be able to replicate the experiments and analyze the order flow imbalance and its impact on price movements.

## Data
